    <li><h3>Always be Curious</h3>
    <p>
        A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated continuously with the latest news and innovations in the field. You need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about front-end development from informative blogs and videos. Following are some of the most informative and useful learning sources for front-end developers 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https:nerist.ac.in/" target="_blank">Frontend Focus</a></li>
        <li><a href="https:nerist.ac.in/" target="_blank">CSS Weekly</a></li>
        <li><a href="https:nerist.ac.in/" target="_blank">JavaScript Weekly</a></li>
        <li><a href="https:nerist.ac.in/" target="_blank">Design Weekly</a> </li>

    </ul>

    <li> <h3>Refactor Your Code From Time To Time</h3></li>
    <p>By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without tampering with its functionality. This will improve the quality and readability quotient of your code and the more often you do it, your code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version of what it was before. Apart from that, one of the most significant advantages that refactoring offers is that it ensures your code remains free from plagiarism. </p>
<li><h3>Automate!</h3></li> 
<p>As a front-end developer, you already have to take care of minute little details that can get overwhelming at times. You have to invest your time on things like Boilerplate, testing, workflow, dependency management, performance, optimization, build, deployment, and so on. Doesn’t sound easy, right? </p>   

<p>Take some steam off yourself and incorporate automation into your workflow. While automation can take care of things such as optimization, testing, etc., you can focus on the core areas of front-end development such as HTML, CSS, creating the client-side software, enhancing the user-experience, and so on. By doing so, not only will your productivity increase, but you will also learn to use your time to focus on the areas that’ll improve the overall functionality of your site. Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli are some very efficient automation tools. </p>
</ol>
<p>While these tips will surely help you become a better front-end designer, in the long run, you must always remember two things while designing your platform – keep it simple and neat, and don’t forget to create your signature style. And for all you peeps interested in making it big in front-end development. </p>
